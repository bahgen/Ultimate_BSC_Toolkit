**THE ULTIMATE BSC TOOLKIT**

Please note that a 'config.py' is required to be made within the same directory with the fields 'private' and 'address' as follows:

to work properly. You can also skip making this file and hard program them into the code, but this is simply housekeeping 
and prevents any accidental leaks.

config.py is added to .gitignore so that it can be personal to all uploaders. This prevents accidental leakage of the private string during upload.
